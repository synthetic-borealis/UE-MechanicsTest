# Unreal Engine mechanics test
## Introduction
This project is a sandbox where I test and prototype miscellaneous game mechanics in Unreal Engine 4 (and later probably 5 as well) before I implement them in other projects.

Pretty much everything here that isn't a shader/material is implemented in blueprints (due to compilation times, C++ will only be used when absolutely necessary).
